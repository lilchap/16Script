# 16Script
Bare-metal i386 embeddable scripting language (currently vm at the moment)

Currently at a rough prototype; still designing vm architecture

## Goals
* Easy interaction with C
* Minimize size of 16Script vm
* Minimize bugs
* Assembler
* 16Script actual script compiler
* Revise cmpflag/control flow (jmps, etc)
* Revise callc
